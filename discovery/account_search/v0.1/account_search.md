# "Fediscovery": Account Search Specification

## Overview

Specification identifier: `account_search`

An important part of discovery is finding people to follow. This
capability offers a very simple API to search for accounts that have
opted-in to being disvovered.

## Performing Full-Fext Searches for Accounts

To perform a full-text search for accounts FASP allow fediverse servers
to make an HTTP `GET` call to the `/account_search/v0/search` endpoint.

The following parameters can be used:

* `term`: This parameter MUST be present and include the text that is to
  be searched for.
* `limit`: This parameter MAY optionally be present to give a positive
  integer number representing the maximum nmber of results FASP should
  return. If omitted this value defaults to `20`.

Example call to search for "teapot" and request at most 10 results:

```http
GET /account_search/v0/search?term=teapot&limit=10
```

If a `term` was present in the request, the response MUST include an
HTTP status code `200` (OK) and a JSON array that includes the URIs
(IDs) of the ActivityPub actor belonging to accounts matching the
requests. These results MUST be sorted by relevance in descending order.

If the `term` is missing from the request, the response MUST include an
HTTP status code `422` (Unprocessable Content).

Example response array:

```json
[
  "https://fedi.example.com/actor/23",
  "https://other.example.com/user/245/actor"
]
```

In case there are more search results than specified by `limit` FASP MAY
allow to paginate more results. To signal that there are more results
FASP MUST include an HTTP `Link` header as described in
[RFC-5988](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5988.html). This header MUST
include the URL of the next page of results with a relation type (`rel`)
of `next`.

## Privacy Policy Information

With the API specified above fediverse servers do share any personally
identifiable or otherwise sensitive information with FASP per se.

But they will probably send search terms entered by actual users of
their platform to FASP. While these cannot be traced back to the user it
might still be something worth noting in the privacy policy.

Fediverse server administrators may add something along the lines of
this to their privacy policy:

> <server> sends search terms entered by users to a third-party search
> service, <fasp>. This service returns relevant data from the fediverse
> that <server> uses to improve search results. No user identifier or
> other PII is shared with <fasp>. <fasp> cannot trace back search terms
> to the user who entered them.
