# Fediverse Auxiliary Service Provider Specifications

This repo collects drafts of specifications for "Fediverse Auxiliary Service Providers". It also serves as a hub for discussions around these specifications.

## What are "Fediverse Auxiliary Service Providers"?

Fediverse Auxiliary Service Providers (FASPs) are independent services that can interact with Fediverse server software to provide services that augment capabilities that are in the server software, are not available in the server software, or cannot be achieved by a single server.

Some examples for these services would be:

* Search and Discovery
* SPAM detection
* Blocklist synchronization
* Link preview generation
* Helpdesk integration
